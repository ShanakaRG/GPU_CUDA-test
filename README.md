# GPU_CUDA-test
This python script can be used to check whether the CUDA installation is correct with the python packages namely Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras.   

before running this script, install GPU versions of the python packages and then run the script. The script allows testing all three above mentioned packages 
but if you need to test a specific one from the above, make sure to comment on the rest. 

For Python package installation guide refer, 

1. Pytorch https://pytorch.org/
2. Tensorflow https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu
3. Keras  https://deeplizard.com/learn/video/IubEtS2JAiY

For Nvidia support packages
